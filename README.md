### The Radon Transform
This code was written as part of the seminar "Computational Methods for X-ray Computed Tomography" at the Technical University of Munich.
It implements the Radon Transform and visualizes how the sinogram is built up theta by theta as the input image rotates.

### Example
This is an example of what the visualization looks like with the Shepp-Logan phantom as input image:
